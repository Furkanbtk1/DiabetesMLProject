# Diabetes & Obesity Risk Prediction Project 🩺

This project is a machine learning-based application designed to predict obesity levels and associated health risks (such as diabetes risk factors) based on an individual's physical characteristics and daily habits.

## 🚀 Project Overview
The model analyzes 17 different parameters including age, height, weight, dietary habits, and physical activity to classify users into specific health categories. The project is integrated into a web interface for real-time predictions.

## 📊 Model Performance
The core of this project is a **Random Forest Classifier** which achieved high performance during testing:
- **Accuracy:** 96%
- **Algorithm:** Random Forest
- **Dataset:** 2111 records with 17 features.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
